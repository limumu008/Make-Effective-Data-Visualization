In order to evaluate a baseball player, the batting average and home runs are two significant indexes. From this project, we can find BMI from weight and height each player and analysis the relation between BMI and two indexes by using visual encoding. Exclude the total relationship, the visualization figure can also animatedly express the relation for different handedness players. Check here.

## Feedback
1. "It looks good. But I'm very interested in the dots in the bottom line. For that dots, the baiting averages are 0, right?
Is it necessary to show on your figure? Or you may need to delete that dots or wrangling your data?"
